# **Machine Learning Projects: A course**

### ***Author: Elizabeth Granda, Bachelor´s Student of Scientific Computing***

The following repository aims to present some of the tasks proposed for the Machine Learning course in the Scientific Computing program at the University of Medellín. It showcases the most relevant tasks, where we learned about supervised and unsupervised Machine Learning (ML) models, as well as neural networks. However, the projects included here mainly focus on supervised classification models, with some regression models as well.

For all the models presented in the different notebooks, the following steps were followed:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** In order to understand the relationships between the variables in each dataset, both among themselves and with respect to the target, a detailed and explained data analysis was performed for all the projects.

2. **Feature Engineering:** To ensure the model works correctly, features requiring cleaning were processed, and new features were created based on others to enhance the model's performance.

3. **Model Application:** Finally, using the selected features, the model was applied, and several tests with different models were conducted to choose the best one.

To improve the organization and comprehension of the content, the projects have been arranged into separate folders, each containing different tasks. The `Classification` folder includes three projects, two of which were assignments throughout the semester. These assignments are found in two subfolders named `Project_1` and `Project_2`, where different classification models are applied to different problems.

There is a third directory within `Classification` called `Final_ML_Project` which consists of the final exam/project for the course. This project involved developing a classification model to detect fraud in bank transactions for one of the world's largest companies, Mercado Libre, using real-world data. This project aimed to bring us, students, a closer to real-world technical tests and experiences in the Machine Learning industry. In addition to creating the model, the professor’s challenge was to deploy the model using `Docker` and `FastAPI`. Therefore, this folder contains several additional files required for the second part of the task. Through this final challenge, we learned about Pipelines and the creation of preprocessing steps in Machine Learning models. The explanation of how this project works is in the [`README.md`](https://github.com/eli12gran/MLProjects/tree/main/Classification/Final_ML_Project) file located in the directory mentioned before.

The notebooks have titles in Spanish; however, all the content in each one is in English, so they can be read freely and without any issues.
